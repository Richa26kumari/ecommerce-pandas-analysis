## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an eCommerce purchases dataset using Python libraries, mainly pandas. The dataset contains details about customer purchases, job titles, emails, languages, and more. The goal is to extract meaningful insights about customer behavior.

## 📁 Dataset Information

- Find average, max, and min purchase prices
- Count users who made purchases in the AM vs PM
- Identify top job titles among users
- Count users with specific email providers (e.g., Gmail)
- Filter users based on purchase price, credit card provider, etc.
- Perform domain extraction from email addresses
- Advanced filters like:
  - Users who use AMEX and made purchases > $95
  - Credit cards expiring in a specific year

## 📊 Libraries Used
